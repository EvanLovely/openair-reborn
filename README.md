OpenAir Reborn
==============

A Chrome extension to improve (fix) the OpenAir time entry grid interface

Sponsored by [Phase2 Technology](http://phase2technology.com).

### Status

This is about 80% complete (for some definition of "complete") but the last 20% includes the crucial step of making the added time actually populate in the OpenAir time grid, so currently it doesn't accomplish anything.

Time is booked in mid-July 2014 to finish up.

### How to help out

1. Clone this repo.
2. In Chrome, go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions).
3. Click the "Developer Mode" checkbox at the top.
4. Click "Load unpacked extension" at the top.
5. Browse to your downloaded repo and select it.
6. Open up an OpenAir timesheet to confirm that the extension is working.
7. Start editing some code! But note that any time you make a change to the extension's code, you need to click "Reload" next to it on the Extensions page for it to get picked up.
